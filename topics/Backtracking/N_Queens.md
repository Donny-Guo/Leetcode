# N-Queens

https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/description/

The **n-queens** puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer `n`, return *all distinct solutions to the **n-queens puzzle***. You may return the answer in **any order**.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: [["Q"]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 9`



**Reflections**:

- Queen can go vertically, horizontally, and diagonally
- we only need three sets to keep track of the place we placed the queen: cols, posDiag, and negDiag
- each row and each column can only has one queen



## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def solveNQueens(self, n: int) -> List[List[str]]:
        col = set()
        posDiag = set()
        negDiag = set()

        res = []
        board = [["."] * n for i in range(n)]

        def backtrack(r):
            if r == n:
                copy = ["".join(row) for row in board]
                res.append(copy)
                return

            for c in range(n):
                if c in col or (r + c) in posDiag or (r - c) in negDiag:
                    continue

                col.add(c)
                posDiag.add(r + c)
                negDiag.add(r - c)
                board[r][c] = "Q"

                backtrack(r + 1)

                col.remove(c)
                posDiag.remove(r + c)
                negDiag.remove(r - c)
                board[r][c] = "."

        backtrack(0)
        return res
```
