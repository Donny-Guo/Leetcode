## Arrays and Hashing

### Group Anagrams

https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

**Output:** [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

**Explanation:**

- There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form `"bat"`.
- The strings `"nat"` and `"tan"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
- The strings `"ate"`, `"eat"`, and `"tea"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = [""]

**Output:** [[""]]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** strs = ["a"]

**Output:** [["a"]]

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 104`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

---

### Top K Frequent Elements

https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the* `k` *most frequent elements*. You may return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
- It is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**.

 

**Follow up:** Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where n is the array's size.

---

### Encode and Decode Strings

https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/description/

Design an algorithm to encode **a list of strings** to **a string**. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:

```
string encode(vector<string> strs) {
  // ... your code
  return encoded_string;
}
```

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

```
vector<string> decode(string s) {
  //... your code
  return strs;
}
```

So Machine 1 does:

```
string encoded_string = encode(strs);
```

and Machine 2 does:

```
vector<string> strs2 = decode(encoded_string);
```

`strs2` in Machine 2 should be the same as `strs` in Machine 1.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.

You are not allowed to solve the problem using any serialize methods (such as `eval`).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: dummy_input = ["Hello","World"]
Output: ["Hello","World"]
Explanation:
Machine 1:
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String msg = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 1 ---msg---> Machine 2

Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String[] strs = decoder.decode(msg);
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: dummy_input = [""]
Output: [""]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
- `strs[i]` contains any possible characters out of `256` valid ASCII characters.

 

**Follow up:** Could you write a generalized algorithm to work on any possible set of characters?

### Product of Array Except Self

https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/

Given an integer array `nums`, return *an array* `answer` *such that* `answer[i]` *is equal to the product of all the elements of* `nums` *except* `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The input is generated such that `answer[i]` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

 

**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

### Valid Sudoku

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](./assets/250px-Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714.svg.png)

```
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.

### Contains Duplicate

https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

The element 1 occurs at the indices 0 and 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

All elements are distinct.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]

**Output:** true

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

---

### Longest Consecutive Sequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.*

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

---

### Valid Anagram

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "rat", t = "car"

**Output:** false

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

 

**Follow up:** What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

---

### Two Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly\* one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= target <= 109`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

 

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?



## Two Pointers

### Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/description/

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already ***sorted in non-decreasing order***, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return *the indices of the two numbers,* `index1` *and* `index2`*, **added by one** as an integer array* `[index1, index2]` *of length 2.*

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers` is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
- The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**.

### 3Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums.length <= 3000`
- `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`



**Reflections**:

1. Be aware that output does not contain duplicate triplet -> how to update index when hitting target and the starting num

### Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return *the maximum amount of water a container can store*.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](./assets/question_11.jpg)

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 104`

### Trapping Rain Water

https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](./assets/rainwatertrap.png)

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 105`

---

### Valid Palindrome

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/
A phrase is a **palindrome** if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` *if it is a **palindrome**, or* `false` *otherwise*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105`
- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.

### Count Pairs Whose Sum is Less than Target

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-whose-sum-is-less-than-target/description/

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, return *the number of pairs* `(i, j)` *where* `0 <= i < j < n` *and* `nums[i] + nums[j] < target`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,1,2,3,1], target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 pairs of indices that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- (0, 1) since 0 < 1 and nums[0] + nums[1] = 0 < target
- (0, 2) since 0 < 2 and nums[0] + nums[2] = 1 < target 
- (0, 4) since 0 < 4 and nums[0] + nums[4] = 0 < target
Note that (0, 3) is not counted since nums[0] + nums[3] is not strictly less than the target.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-6,2,5,-2,-7,-1,3], target = -2
Output: 10
Explanation: There are 10 pairs of indices that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- (0, 1) since 0 < 1 and nums[0] + nums[1] = -4 < target
- (0, 3) since 0 < 3 and nums[0] + nums[3] = -8 < target
- (0, 4) since 0 < 4 and nums[0] + nums[4] = -13 < target
- (0, 5) since 0 < 5 and nums[0] + nums[5] = -7 < target
- (0, 6) since 0 < 6 and nums[0] + nums[6] = -3 < target
- (1, 4) since 1 < 4 and nums[1] + nums[4] = -5 < target
- (3, 4) since 3 < 4 and nums[3] + nums[4] = -9 < target
- (3, 5) since 3 < 5 and nums[3] + nums[5] = -3 < target
- (4, 5) since 4 < 5 and nums[4] + nums[5] = -8 < target
- (4, 6) since 4 < 6 and nums[4] + nums[6] = -4 < target
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length == n <= 50`
- `-50 <= nums[i], target <= 50`

### Count the Number of Fair Pairs

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-fair-pairs/description/

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of size `n` and two integers `lower` and `upper`, return *the number of fair pairs*.

A pair `(i, j)` is **fair** if:

- `0 <= i < j < n`, and
- `lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper`

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,7,4,4,5], lower = 3, upper = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 fair pairs: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,7,9,2,5], lower = 11, upper = 11
Output: 1
Explanation: There is a single fair pair: (2,3).
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `nums.length == n`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= lower <= upper <= 109`

## Stack

### Min Stack

https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/description/

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
- `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
- `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `-231 <= val <= 231 - 1`
- Methods `pop`, `top` and `getMin` operations will always be called on **non-empty** stacks.
- At most `3 * 104` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin`.

You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in a [Reverse Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Evaluate the expression. Return *an integer that represents the value of the expression*.

**Note** that:

- The valid operators are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
- The division between two integers always **truncates toward zero**.
- There will not be any division by zero.
- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
- The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a **32-bit** integer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= tokens.length <= 104`
- `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.

### Car Fleet

https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/description/

There are `n` cars at given miles away from the starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile `target`.

You are given two integer array `position` and `speed`, both of length `n`, where `position[i]` is the starting mile of the `ith` car and `speed[i]` is the speed of the `ith` car in miles per hour.

A car cannot pass another car, but it can catch up and then travel next to it at the speed of the slower car.

A **car fleet** is a car or cars driving next to each other. The speed of the car fleet is the **minimum** speed of any car in the fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet at the mile `target`, it will still be considered as part of the car fleet.

Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

- The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12. The fleet forms at `target`.
- The car starting at 0 (speed 1) does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
- The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches `target`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

- The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The car starting at 4 (speed 1) travels to 5.
- Then, the fleet at 4 (speed 2) and the car at position 5 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches `target`.

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == position.length == speed.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `0 < target <= 106`
- `0 <= position[i] < target`
- All the values of `position` are **unique**.
- `0 < speed[i] <= 106`

### Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return *the minimum element of this array*.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

### Search in Rotated Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return *the index of* `target` *if it is in* `nums`*, or* `-1` *if it is not in* `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`

### Time Based Key-Value Store

https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/description/

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Implement the `TimeMap` class:

- `TimeMap()` Initializes the object of the data structure.
- `void set(String key, String value, int timestamp)` Stores the key `key` with the value `value` at the given time `timestamp`.
- `String get(String key, int timestamp)` Returns a value such that `set` was called previously, with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest `timestamp_prev`. If there are no values, it returns `""`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["TimeMap", "set", "get", "get", "set", "get", "get"]
[[], ["foo", "bar", 1], ["foo", 1], ["foo", 3], ["foo", "bar2", 4], ["foo", 4], ["foo", 5]]
Output
[null, null, "bar", "bar", null, "bar2", "bar2"]

Explanation
TimeMap timeMap = new TimeMap();
timeMap.set("foo", "bar", 1);  // store the key "foo" and value "bar" along with timestamp = 1.
timeMap.get("foo", 1);         // return "bar"
timeMap.get("foo", 3);         // return "bar", since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 is "bar".
timeMap.set("foo", "bar2", 4); // store the key "foo" and value "bar2" along with timestamp = 4.
timeMap.get("foo", 4);         // return "bar2"
timeMap.get("foo", 5);         // return "bar2"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= key.length, value.length <= 100`
- `key` and `value` consist of lowercase English letters and digits.
- `1 <= timestamp <= 107`
- All the timestamps `timestamp` of `set` are strictly increasing.
- At most `2 * 105` calls will be made to `set` and `get`.

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 105`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

### Copy List with Random Pointer

https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/description/

A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return *the head of the copied linked list*.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

- `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
- `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](./assets/e1.png)

```
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](./assets/e2.png)

```
Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]
```

**Example 3:**

**![img](./assets/e3.png)**

```
Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n <= 1000`
- `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`
- `Node.random` is `null` or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

### LRU Cache

https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/description/

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a **[Least Recently Used (LRU) cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU)**.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

- `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with **positive** size `capacity`.
- `int get(int key)` Return the value of the `key` if the key exists, otherwise return `-1`.
- `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, **evict** the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["LRUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= capacity <= 3000`
- `0 <= key <= 104`
- `0 <= value <= 105`
- At most `2 * 105` calls will be made to `get` and `put`.

### Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

 

**Example 1:**

![img](./assets/binarysearchtree_improved.png)

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](./assets/binarysearchtree_improved.png)

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
- `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
- All `Node.val` are **unique**.

- `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.



**Reflections**:

- Binary search tree: is a sorted binary tree (each node's value is greater all the node values in the left subtree and smaller than all node values in the right subtree)
- since it is a binary search tree, we can easily tell locate which direction to look for node.

### Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/description/

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/32442719377939-How-to-create-test-cases-on-LeetCode#h_01J5EGREAW3NAEJ14XC07GRW1A). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](./assets/serdeser.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None

### Last Stone Weight

https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/description/

You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the `ith` stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the **heaviest two stones** and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:

- If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed, and
- If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.

At the end of the game, there is **at most one** stone left.

Return *the weight of the last remaining stone*. If there are no stones left, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: stones = [1]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
- `1 <= stones[i] <= 1000`

### K Closest Points to Origin

https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/description/

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `√(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2`).

You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).

 

**Example 1:**

![img](./assets/closestplane1.jpg)

```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= points.length <= 104`
- `-104 <= xi, yi <= 104`

### Task Scheduler

https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/description/

You are given an array of CPU `tasks`, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number `n`. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of **at least** `n` intervals between two tasks with the same label.

Return the **minimum** number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.

After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.

With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.

There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= tasks.length <= 104`
- `tasks[i]` is an uppercase English letter.
- `0 <= n <= 100`

### Design Twitter

https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/description/

Design a simplified version of Twitter where users can post tweets, follow/unfollow another user, and is able to see the `10` most recent tweets in the user's news feed.

Implement the `Twitter` class:

- `Twitter()` Initializes your twitter object.
- `void postTweet(int userId, int tweetId)` Composes a new tweet with ID `tweetId` by the user `userId`. Each call to this function will be made with a unique `tweetId`.
- `List<Integer> getNewsFeed(int userId)` Retrieves the `10` most recent tweet IDs in the user's news feed. Each item in the news feed must be posted by users who the user followed or by the user themself. Tweets must be **ordered from most recent to least recent**.
- `void follow(int followerId, int followeeId)` The user with ID `followerId` started following the user with ID `followeeId`.
- `void unfollow(int followerId, int followeeId)` The user with ID `followerId` started unfollowing the user with ID `followeeId`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["Twitter", "postTweet", "getNewsFeed", "follow", "postTweet", "getNewsFeed", "unfollow", "getNewsFeed"]
[[], [1, 5], [1], [1, 2], [2, 6], [1], [1, 2], [1]]
Output
[null, null, [5], null, null, [6, 5], null, [5]]

Explanation
Twitter twitter = new Twitter();
twitter.postTweet(1, 5); // User 1 posts a new tweet (id = 5).
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);  // User 1's news feed should return a list with 1 tweet id -> [5]. return [5]
twitter.follow(1, 2);    // User 1 follows user 2.
twitter.postTweet(2, 6); // User 2 posts a new tweet (id = 6).
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);  // User 1's news feed should return a list with 2 tweet ids -> [6, 5]. Tweet id 6 should precede tweet id 5 because it is posted after tweet id 5.
twitter.unfollow(1, 2);  // User 1 unfollows user 2.
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);  // User 1's news feed should return a list with 1 tweet id -> [5], since user 1 is no longer following user 2.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= userId, followerId, followeeId <= 500`
- `0 <= tweetId <= 104`
- All the tweets have **unique** IDs.
- At most `3 * 104` calls will be made to `postTweet`, `getNewsFeed`, `follow`, and `unfollow`.
- A user cannot follow himself.

### Find Median from Data Stream

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/description/

The **median** is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

- For example, for `arr = [2,3,4]`, the median is `3`.
- For example, for `arr = [2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Implement the MedianFinder class:

- `MedianFinder()` initializes the `MedianFinder` object.
- `void addNum(int num)` adds the integer `num` from the data stream to the data structure.
- `double findMedian()` returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

Explanation
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `-105 <= num <= 105`
- There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling `findMedian`.
- At most `5 * 104` calls will be made to `addNum` and `findMedian`.

 

**Follow up:**

- If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?
- If `99%` of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?
