## Arrays and Hashing

### Group Anagrams

https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

**Output:** [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

**Explanation:**

- There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form `"bat"`.
- The strings `"nat"` and `"tan"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
- The strings `"ate"`, `"eat"`, and `"tea"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = [""]

**Output:** [[""]]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** strs = ["a"]

**Output:** [["a"]]

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 104`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Top K Frequent Elements

https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the* `k` *most frequent elements*. You may return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
- It is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**.

 

**Follow up:** Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where n is the array's size.
