## Arrays and Hashing

### Group Anagrams

https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

**Output:** [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

**Explanation:**

- There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form `"bat"`.
- The strings `"nat"` and `"tan"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
- The strings `"ate"`, `"eat"`, and `"tea"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = [""]

**Output:** [[""]]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** strs = ["a"]

**Output:** [["a"]]

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 104`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Top K Frequent Elements

https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the* `k` *most frequent elements*. You may return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
- It is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**.

 

**Follow up:** Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where n is the array's size.

### Encode and Decode Strings

https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/description/

Design an algorithm to encode **a list of strings** to **a string**. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:

```
string encode(vector<string> strs) {
  // ... your code
  return encoded_string;
}
```

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

```
vector<string> decode(string s) {
  //... your code
  return strs;
}
```

So Machine 1 does:

```
string encoded_string = encode(strs);
```

and Machine 2 does:

```
vector<string> strs2 = decode(encoded_string);
```

`strs2` in Machine 2 should be the same as `strs` in Machine 1.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.

You are not allowed to solve the problem using any serialize methods (such as `eval`).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: dummy_input = ["Hello","World"]
Output: ["Hello","World"]
Explanation:
Machine 1:
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String msg = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 1 ---msg---> Machine 2

Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String[] strs = decoder.decode(msg);
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: dummy_input = [""]
Output: [""]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
- `strs[i]` contains any possible characters out of `256` valid ASCII characters.

 

**Follow up:** Could you write a generalized algorithm to work on any possible set of characters?
