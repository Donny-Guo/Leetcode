## Arrays and Hashing

### Group Anagrams

https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

**Output:** [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

**Explanation:**

- There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form `"bat"`.
- The strings `"nat"` and `"tan"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
- The strings `"ate"`, `"eat"`, and `"tea"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = [""]

**Output:** [[""]]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** strs = ["a"]

**Output:** [["a"]]

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 104`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

---

### Top K Frequent Elements

https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the* `k` *most frequent elements*. You may return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
- It is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**.

 

**Follow up:** Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where n is the array's size.

---

### Encode and Decode Strings

https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/description/

Design an algorithm to encode **a list of strings** to **a string**. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:

```
string encode(vector<string> strs) {
  // ... your code
  return encoded_string;
}
```

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

```
vector<string> decode(string s) {
  //... your code
  return strs;
}
```

So Machine 1 does:

```
string encoded_string = encode(strs);
```

and Machine 2 does:

```
vector<string> strs2 = decode(encoded_string);
```

`strs2` in Machine 2 should be the same as `strs` in Machine 1.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.

You are not allowed to solve the problem using any serialize methods (such as `eval`).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: dummy_input = ["Hello","World"]
Output: ["Hello","World"]
Explanation:
Machine 1:
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String msg = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 1 ---msg---> Machine 2

Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String[] strs = decoder.decode(msg);
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: dummy_input = [""]
Output: [""]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
- `strs[i]` contains any possible characters out of `256` valid ASCII characters.

 

**Follow up:** Could you write a generalized algorithm to work on any possible set of characters?

### Product of Array Except Self

https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/

Given an integer array `nums`, return *an array* `answer` *such that* `answer[i]` *is equal to the product of all the elements of* `nums` *except* `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The input is generated such that `answer[i]` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

 

**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

### Valid Sudoku

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](./assets/250px-Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714.svg.png)

```
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.

---

### Longest Consecutive Sequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.*

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

---

### Valid Anagram

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"

### Two Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly\* one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= target <= 109`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

 

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?



## Two Pointers

### Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/description/

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already ***sorted in non-decreasing order***, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return *the indices of the two numbers,* `index1` *and* `index2`*, **added by one** as an integer array* `[index1, index2]` *of length 2.*

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers` is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
- The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**.

### 3Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums.length <= 3000`
- `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`



**Reflections**:

1. Be aware that output does not contain duplicate triplet -> how to update index when hitting target and the starting num

---

### Valid Palindrome

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/
A phrase is a **palindrome** if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` *if it is a **palindrome**, or* `false` *otherwise*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
```

 

**Constraints:**

### Count Pairs Whose Sum is Less than Target

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-whose-sum-is-less-than-target/description/

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, return *the number of pairs* `(i, j)` *where* `0 <= i < j < n` *and* `nums[i] + nums[j] < target`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,1,2,3,1], target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 pairs of indices that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- (0, 1) since 0 < 1 and nums[0] + nums[1] = 0 < target
- (0, 2) since 0 < 2 and nums[0] + nums[2] = 1 < target 
- (0, 4) since 0 < 4 and nums[0] + nums[4] = 0 < target
Note that (0, 3) is not counted since nums[0] + nums[3] is not strictly less than the target.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-6,2,5,-2,-7,-1,3], target = -2
Output: 10
Explanation: There are 10 pairs of indices that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- (0, 1) since 0 < 1 and nums[0] + nums[1] = -4 < target
- (0, 3) since 0 < 3 and nums[0] + nums[3] = -8 < target
- (0, 4) since 0 < 4 and nums[0] + nums[4] = -13 < target
- (0, 5) since 0 < 5 and nums[0] + nums[5] = -7 < target
- (0, 6) since 0 < 6 and nums[0] + nums[6] = -3 < target
- (1, 4) since 1 < 4 and nums[1] + nums[4] = -5 < target
- (3, 4) since 3 < 4 and nums[3] + nums[4] = -9 < target
- (3, 5) since 3 < 5 and nums[3] + nums[5] = -3 < target
- (4, 5) since 4 < 5 and nums[4] + nums[5] = -8 < target
- (4, 6) since 4 < 6 and nums[4] + nums[6] = -4 < target
```

 

**Constraints:**

## Stack

### Min Stack

https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/description/

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
- `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
- `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `-231 <= val <= 231 - 1`
- Methods `pop`, `top` and `getMin` operations will always be called on **non-empty** stacks.
- At most `3 * 104` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin`.

### Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/description/

You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in a [Reverse Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Evaluate the expression. Return *an integer that represents the value of the expression*.

**Note** that:

- The valid operators are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
- The division between two integers always **truncates toward zero**.
- There will not be any division by zero.
- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
- The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a **32-bit** integer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= tokens.length <= 104`
- `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.

### Car Fleet

https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/description/

There are `n` cars at given miles away from the starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile `target`.

You are given two integer array `position` and `speed`, both of length `n`, where `position[i]` is the starting mile of the `ith` car and `speed[i]` is the speed of the `ith` car in miles per hour.

A car cannot pass another car, but it can catch up and then travel next to it at the speed of the slower car.

A **car fleet** is a car or cars driving next to each other. The speed of the car fleet is the **minimum** speed of any car in the fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet at the mile `target`, it will still be considered as part of the car fleet.

Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

- The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12. The fleet forms at `target`.
- The car starting at 0 (speed 1) does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
- The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches `target`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

- The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The car starting at 4 (speed 1) travels to 5.
- Then, the fleet at 4 (speed 2) and the car at position 5 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches `target`.

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == position.length == speed.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `0 < target <= 106`
- `0 <= position[i] < target`
- All the values of `position` are **unique**.
- `0 < speed[i] <= 106`

### Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return *the minimum element of this array*.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

### Search in Rotated Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return *the index of* `target` *if it is in* `nums`*, or* `-1` *if it is not in* `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`

### Time Based Key-Value Store

https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/description/

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Implement the `TimeMap` class:

- `TimeMap()` Initializes the object of the data structure.
- `void set(String key, String value, int timestamp)` Stores the key `key` with the value `value` at the given time `timestamp`.
- `String get(String key, int timestamp)` Returns a value such that `set` was called previously, with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest `timestamp_prev`. If there are no values, it returns `""`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["TimeMap", "set", "get", "get", "set", "get", "get"]
[[], ["foo", "bar", 1], ["foo", 1], ["foo", 3], ["foo", "bar2", 4], ["foo", 4], ["foo", 5]]
Output
[null, null, "bar", "bar", null, "bar2", "bar2"]

Explanation
TimeMap timeMap = new TimeMap();
timeMap.set("foo", "bar", 1);  // store the key "foo" and value "bar" along with timestamp = 1.
timeMap.get("foo", 1);         // return "bar"
timeMap.get("foo", 3);         // return "bar", since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 is "bar".
timeMap.set("foo", "bar2", 4); // store the key "foo" and value "bar2" along with timestamp = 4.
timeMap.get("foo", 4);         // return "bar2"
timeMap.get("foo", 5);         // return "bar2"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= key.length, value.length <= 100`
- `key` and `value` consist of lowercase English letters and digits.
- `1 <= timestamp <= 107`
- All the timestamps `timestamp` of `set` are strictly increasing.
- At most `2 * 105` calls will be made to `set` and `get`.

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0

Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 105`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

### Copy List with Random Pointer

https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/description/

A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return *the head of the copied linked list*.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

- `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
- `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](./assets/e1.png)

### Find the Duplicate Number

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description/

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return *this repeated number*.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and using only constant extra space.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.

 

**Follow up:**

- How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
- Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

### LRU Cache

https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/description/

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a **[Least Recently Used (LRU) cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU)**.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

- `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with **positive** size `capacity`.
- `int get(int key)` Return the value of the `key` if the key exists, otherwise return `-1`.
- `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, **evict** the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["LRUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= capacity <= 3000`
- `0 <= key <= 104`
- `0 <= value <= 105`
- At most `2 * 105` calls will be made to `get` and `put`.

### Merge k Sorted Lists

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/description/

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

*Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: lists = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `k == lists.length`
- `0 <= k <= 104`
- `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
- `-104 <= lists[i][j] <= 104`
- `lists[i]` is sorted in **ascending order**.
- The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `104`.

### Reverse Nodes in k-Group

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/

Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return *the modified list*.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](./assets/reverse_ex1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](./assets/reverse_ex2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

 

**Follow-up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra memory space?

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
